# TextEditor
Text editors are the programmers best friend or number one enemy 
they either can make his work really easy and flowing or hard and repitive over the smallest problems 
so a programmer look for three things while choosing a text editor 
* Text highliting 
* Predictive text 
* Theme choosing (for eye comfort in long coding seessions)
we are using the visual studio code for this because its the most sutible one and for all the extentions that it provides to support coders
